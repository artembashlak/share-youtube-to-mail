Steps to move project to POM structure:
1. Create fixture to open browser (webdriver)
2. Create base page class with methods that knows how to work with driver -> find, wait, go to site
3. Create page class that uses methods from base page and contains locators. Plus, it has methods to work with page,
not driver
4. Create test that uses only methods of page class

Structure how POM should work:

Conftest with driver init fixture -> Base page(get url, wait) -> Page -> Test
